Simple Reminder Editing for iOS Simulator

Although the iOS simulator happily supports EventKit there isn't any built in way to populate or edit the database which can be a little inconvenient when taking your first steps into EventKit.

This app is an extremly simple reminders app that allows lists and reminders to be created/edited/removed. It's far from production ready and contains a number of things that should really be handled better in shipping code.

PS - This is also the largest amount of code I've written in Swift. Apologies in advance for the occasional semicolon and my indecisiveness around when to use self, optionals, unwrapping etc.
